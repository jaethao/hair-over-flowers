Hairs Over Flowers is a hair salon appointment setter application. The app consists of both a user and an admin side. On the user side, the app displays a calendar with open time slots for hair appointment. The users can click on the available slots and enter in their contact information to make an appointment. The user will receive a confirmation email when an appointment has been scheduled. On the admin side, the owner can login with his/her login info to view all customer appointments. Admin can delete appointments when a client calls to cancel.
